NAME
----
mtf_generate_test_chart - generate test charts for evaluating lens sharpness

SYNOPSIS
--------
*mtf_generate_test_chart* ['OPTIONS']

DESCRIPTION
-----------
*mtf_generate_test_chart* generates scalable vector graphics (SVG) files containing test charts for 
evaluating digital camera lens performance (sharpness) as well as autofocus accuracy / fine-tuning.
*mtf_generate_test_chart*  should be used to generate suitable test charts
for use with the *mtf_mapper* tool.

OPTIONS
-------
*-o* 'filename'::
Specify output file name (default is _chart.svg_).

*-s* 'a4|A4|a3|A3|a2|A2|a1|A1|a0|A0'::
Specify page size of the chart.

*-t* 'perspective|grid|halfgrid|thirdgrid|lensgrid|mfperspective|focus'::
Specify chart type. The _perspective_ chart is for evaluating autofocus
behaviour, and is intended to be photographed at an angle, typically 45
degrees. 
+
The _lensgrid_ chart is intended to evaluate lens sharpness across the
focal plane, and should be photographed perpendiculary. This chart type is
suitable for many *mtf_mapper* output options, including *-a*, *-s*, *-q*,
and *--lensprofile*. The circular fiducial markers also allow this chart type
to be used for iteratively adjusting the chart orientation (to position it
perpendicular to the camera's optical axis) using *mtf_mapper*'s
*--chart-orientation* output mode.
+
The _grid_ chart is similar to the _lensgrid_ chart, but it is an older
design, and it is strongly recommended that you use the _lensgrid_ chart
instead. Similar grid-style charts, but with fewer target rectangles, can be
generated using the _halfgrid_ and _thirdgrid_ types.
+
The _focus_ chart is a single-purpose chart type designed to measure the
position (distance) of peak focus. This chart must be photographed at an
angle (45 degrees recommended), and requires manual focusing. The *--focus*
output option of *mtf_mapper* is specifically intended for this chart type.
+
The _mfperspective_ chart is another special chart type designed to
visualize the intersection of the "'plane of best focus'" and the test
chart, which should be tilted at around 45 degrees. The *--mfprofile* output
option of *mtf_mapper* is specifically intended for this chart type.

*-d* 'distance'::
Specify the desired viewing distance from the chart for perspective mode.
Distance is in mm, measured from the reference edge on the chart, to the
camera focal plane.

*-h*::
Displays usage information.
